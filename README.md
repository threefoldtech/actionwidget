### Option one: soft (/signup_internet)

 I want an internet

- which allows me to ownf my own data and digital life
- where abuse of my information is not tolerated
-  without the need to burn crazy amounts of fossil fuel to provide my digital life
- where everyone has equal chances
- where I can trust my country to protect my safety and rights
- which is available everywhere in the world at a cost lower than today
- Supported by a token that has real value and represents this new internet (not like dollars trillions will be printed, not like bitcoin no backing)

### Option two strong (/signup_cyborg):

- I realize that my cyborg part is not owned by me, I am part of some big AI driven internet cloud.

- I do not agree that the internet is using up to 10% of the world's electricity and this will become multiple times worse. There needs to be an alternative which is good for the planet.
- I do not agree that the global neutral internet is disappearing, it's being cut in pieces, firewalls are installed everywhere, my data is abused, information is often fake manipulated and there is not much we can do about it, ...
